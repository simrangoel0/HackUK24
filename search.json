            "Forms of Fentanyl Citrate Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid typically used to treat patients with chronic severe pain or severe pain following surgery. Fentanyl is a Schedule II controlled substance that is similar to morphine but about 100 times more potent. Under the supervision of a licensed medical professional, fentanyl has a legitimate medical use.",
            "Producing illicit fentanyl is not an exact science. Two milligrams of fentanyl can be lethal depending on a person\u2019s body size, tolerance and past usage. DEA analysis has found counterfeit pills ranging from .02 to 5.1 milligrams (more than twice the lethal dose) of fentanyl per tablet.",
            "It is also possible to take a pill knowing it contains fentanyl, but with no way of knowing if it contains a lethal dose. According to the CDC, synthetic opioids (like fentanyl) are the primary driver of overdose deaths in the United States. Comparison between 12 months-ending January 31, 2020 and the 12 months-ending January 31, 2021 during this period: Overdose deaths involving opioids rose 38.1 percent.",
            "Fentanyl is being mixed in with other illicit drugs to increase the potency of the drug, sold as powders and nasal sprays, and increasingly pressed into pills made to look like legitimate prescription opioids. Because there is no official oversight or quality control, these counterfeit pills often contain lethal doses of fentanyl, with none of the promised drug."

            "Drug dealers often sell fentanyl mixed with methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine, and other drugs. Because fentanyl is so potent in small amounts, it is cheaper to make and enhances the effect of other drugs. Unfortunately, many people who buy drugs on the street may unknowingly get a mixture containing lethal doses of fentanyl.",
            "Not only can fentanyl and other opiates be addictive, but they also can be lethal. This is especially true when mixing heroin, cocaine, meth, and/or fentanyl together. It is also very dangerous to buy street drugs because you never know if fentanyl might be mixed into it.",
            "The prescription forms of fentanyl contain small, diluted amounts of the drug. When you hear about people overdosing, those cases typically involve an illegally made form of fentanyl. Fentanyl abuse first appeared in the 1970s and has been on the rise due to its euphoric (feelings of intense pleasure) effects.",

Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid1https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Fentanyl developed in the 1960s and used as a painkiller to treat moderate to severe pain."
